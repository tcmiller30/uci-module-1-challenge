# UCI Module 1 Challenge

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This is a website for a marketing agency to educate users on the importance of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The codebase of the site has been altered to reflect the importance of this by changing non-semantic elements in the code to semantic elements. 

## Installation

N/A


## Usage
In order to use this website, open the webpage in your browser to launch the homepage. To confirm non-semantic elements were replaced with semantic elements, you can open the browser's DevTools/Inspector--CTRL+Shift+I for Windows, CMD+Option+I for Mac--which will open a console panel on the side of your screen displaying the site's code. 

Use the Navbar at the top of the screen to quickly move between topics on the page and learn about the importance of Search Engine Optimization.
