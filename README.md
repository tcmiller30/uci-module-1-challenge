This is a website for a marketing agency to educate users on the importance of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The codebase of the site has been altered to reflect the importance of this by changing non-semantic elements in the code to semantic elements.

This exercise stressed the importance of the inclusion of semantic elements in a website's HTML, as well as the importance of meeting accessibility standards
